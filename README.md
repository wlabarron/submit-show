# Submit Show tool
This tool allows a radio station to accept show recordings from presenters or producers, ready for playout or replay, and can automatically publish them to Mixcloud at a specified time.

* Allows people to send in radio shows without having to try and email large files.
* Automatically publishes shows to Mixcloud at the specified time, without sharing the Mixcloud password with the whole
  team.
* Can send an email notification to your scheduling team when a new show is submitted.
* Can send an email notification to the person who submitted the show once it's published on Mixcloud.
* Mixcloud publication notification emails can contain shortened URLs ready for sharing
  with [YOURLS](https://yourls.org) integration.
* Can use SAML for authentication and getting addresses for email notifications.
* Reads show names and presenters from a separate database - so you can create your own database, or integrate with
  another existing system and write custom SQL queries to get show information.
* Make your Mixcloud uploads look consistent and professional with auto-written titles based on the show info in the
  database, and a custom addition to all show descriptions.
* Make submitting shows nice and easy by saving images, tags, and descriptions ready for next time.
